# Advanced Data Analysis Course Projects

This repo contains all of my project that I've done in the Advanced Data Analysis Nanodegree course from Udacity.

1. Project 1: FBI Firearm Background Check Analysis report to answer some questions, calculating statistics about the variables, and drawing conclusions with some visuals about the data.
2. Project 2: A/B Test Results Analysis report using hypothesis testing and simple logistic regression model to statistically determine whether a user will convert to the new changes or not.
3. Project 3: Ford GoBike data system data exploration analysis to explore the main features that may effect on the rides by the distance, days, and which type of users.
